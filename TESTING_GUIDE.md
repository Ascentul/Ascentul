# Ascentul Testing Guide

## Current Status
‚ùå **Automated Testing**: Not configured (no test suite)

- `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`

**Priority 2 - Core Navigation**:
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

**Priority 3 - Admin Features**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/analytics/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/university/page.tsx`

**Priority 4 - Account & Settings**:

## Setting Up Automated Testing (Future)

To implement proper testing, consider adding:

### Testing Framework Setup
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.4.3",
    "jest": "^29.5.0",
    "jest-environment-jsdom": "^29.5.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  }
}
```

### Recommended Test Categories
