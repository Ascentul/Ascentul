# Ascentul Testing Guide

## Current Status
❌ **Automated Testing**: Not configured (no test suite)
❌ **Build Status**: Blocked by merge conflicts
✅ **Implementation**: All features completed and documented

## Immediate Steps Required

### 1. Resolve Merge Conflicts
The following files have merge conflict markers that prevent compilation:

**Priority 1 - Authentication Flow**:
- `src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`

**Priority 2 - Core Navigation**:
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

**Priority 3 - Admin Features**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/analytics/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/university/page.tsx`

**Priority 4 - Account & Settings**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/account/page.tsx`

## Testing Patterns

### Module Cache & Feature Flags

Feature flag modules evaluate environment variables at import time. Changing `process.env` after an ESM import will not refresh cached values. Use the shared helper below to guarantee clean setup/teardown in Vitest:

```typescript
// tests/helpers/featureFlagTestHelper.ts
import { vi } from 'vitest';

/**
 * Vitest API reference for env helpers:
 * vi.stubEnv(name: string, value: string): Vitest
 *   - name: environment variable to override
 *   - value: replacement string that will be visible via process.env[name]
 * Cleanup is performed globally with vi.unstubAllEnvs().
 */
export function testWithFeatureFlag<T>(
  flags: Record<string, string>,
  testFn: () => Promise<T>
): Promise<T>;
export function testWithFeatureFlag<T>(
  flags: Record<string, string>,
  testFn: () => T
): T;
export function testWithFeatureFlag<T>(
  flags: Record<string, string>,
  testFn: () => Promise<T> | T
): Promise<T> | T {
  const cleanup = () => {
    vi.unstubAllEnvs();
  };

  try {
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(flags)) {
      vi.stubEnv(key, value);
    }

    vi.resetModules();
    const result = testFn();
    if (result instanceof Promise) {
      return result.finally(cleanup);
    }

    cleanup();
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    cleanup();
    throw error;
  }
}
```

Usage:

```typescript
import { testWithFeatureFlag } from '../helpers/featureFlagTestHelper';

it('reads feature flag overrides', async () => {
  const flagValue = await testWithFeatureFlag(
    { THUMBNAIL_PREFER_BASE64: 'true' },
    async () => {
      const { FEATURE_FLAGS } = await import('@/convex/lib/featureFlags');
      return FEATURE_FLAGS.THUMBNAIL_PREFER_BASE64;
    }
  );

  expect(flagValue).toBe(true);
});
```

- Always call `require`/dynamic `import()` **after** `vi.resetModules()` so the module reloads with the stubbed env vars.
- Wrap `vi.stubEnv` in `try/finally` (the helper handles this for you) to avoid leaking environment state into other tests.
- Note: Feature flag module parses string env vars into typed values (e.g., `'true'` → `true`).
- Helpers should always use `try/finally` for cleanup so parallel test runs don't leak state.
- For other env-sensitive modules, create similar helpers (e.g., `testWithEnv`, `testWithMockedStorage`) and follow the same cleanup pattern to avoid test pollution.

## Setting Up Automated Testing (Future)

To implement proper testing, consider adding:

### Testing Framework Setup
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.4.3",
    "jest": "^29.5.0",
    "jest-environment-jsdom": "^29.5.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  }
}
```

### Recommended Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Component rendering and functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: User flows and API interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user journeys with Playwright/Cypress
4. **Visual Tests**: UI consistency and regression testing

## Deployment Readiness

✅ **Code Quality**: All features implemented
✅ **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide provided
❌ **Build Status**: Requires conflict resolution
❌ **Test Coverage**: No automated tests configured

**Recommendation**: Resolve merge conflicts, perform manual testing, then deploy to staging for user acceptance testing.
