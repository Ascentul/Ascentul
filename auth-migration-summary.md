# Authentication Migration Summary

## Completed Changes

1. **Removed Session-Based Authentication:**

   - Removed all references to `req.session` throughout the codebase
   - Replaced session-based identity checks with Supabase token verification
   - Updated all routes to use `req.userId` from the Supabase JWT authentication
   - Removed sessionStore property from all storage classes and IStorage interface

2. **Updated Files:**

   - `auth.ts` - Now fully uses Supabase token verification
   - `routes.ts` - Removed all references to req.session.userId, using req.userId instead
   - `career-path.ts` - Updated to use Supabase tokens, with proper conversion from string to number IDs
   - `user-role.ts` - Updated to convert string userIds to numbers for database compatibility
   - `ai-coach.ts` - Updated to convert string userIds to numbers for storage functions
   - `index.ts` - Updated comments to reflect token-based auth instead of sessions
   - `storage.ts` - Removed all sessionStore properties and references
   - `supabase-storage.ts` - Removed express-session imports and SupabaseStore class

3. **Type Handling:**

   - Added proper conversion from string userIds (from JWT) to number userIds (for database)
   - Used `parseInt(req.userId)` where needed for database operations

4. **Removed Unused Code:**

   - Renamed `session-store.backup.ts` to `session-store.backup.deprecated.ts` to indicate it's no longer used
   - Removed all express-session imports throughout the codebase

5. **Fixed Contacts Routes:**
   - Updated user ID handling in contacts.ts to properly use the Supabase auth token
   - Modified handleDevMode function to attempt multiple user fallbacks in development mode
   - Created script (fix-contacts-auth.sh) to standardize user ID handling across all contact endpoints
6. **Fixed User Profile Route:**
   - Updated `/api/users/me` endpoint to use the requireLoginFallback middleware
   - Fixed user ID handling to properly convert string IDs to numbers for database operations
   - Added improved error logging and debugging information

## Additional Notes

- The Supabase authentication token is now used exclusively throughout the application
- User identification is handled by the `verifySupabaseToken` middleware which sets:

  - `req.user` - The full user object from the database
  - `req.userId` - The user's ID (as a string) from the JWT

- Database operations still expect numeric IDs, so we convert the string userId to a number when needed
- Session management has been completely removed from the codebase:
  - No more express-session middleware
  - No more session storage in database or memory
  - No dependencies on session for authentication

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all authentication flows to ensure they work properly:
   - Login with Supabase credentials
   - Token expiration and refresh
   - Protected route access
2. Verify that user identification works correctly in all routes:
   - Special attention to routes that previously used req.session.userId
   - Test with both valid tokens and development mode fallbacks
3. Check that admin and staff role checks function as expected
4. Ensure database operations with user IDs work correctly:
   - Confirm numeric userId conversion for database operations
   - Verify that string userId works for Supabase operations
5. Test performance improvements from eliminating session overhead
6. Validate fallback authentication in development mode:
   - Test with token "dev_token" to trigger the fallback
   - Test with missing Authorization header
