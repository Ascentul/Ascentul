# Ascentul Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Ascentul docs. This repository has been reorganized to keep the project root clean and to separate current docs from legacy resources.

## Current Architecture

- Frontend: Next.js App Router (TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Auth: Clerk
- Database: Convex
- Realtime + typed queries: Convex functions and generated types

For implementation details, see the code under `src/` and `convex/`.

## Legacy Notice

The project has fully migrated to Clerk + Convex. Any Supabase-related guides are archived under `docs/legacy/supabase/` and kept only for historical reference. Do not add new Supabase code, env vars, or RLS. All persistence must use Convex queries/mutations in `convex/`.

## Conventions

- New documentation should live under `docs/`.
- Archived/legacy docs must live under `docs/legacy/` with a banner at the top indicating deprecation.
- Keep the project root limited to operational files (e.g., `README.md`, configs) and avoid adding new Markdown files there.
