# Project Reorganization

## Before
The project structure was disorganized with:
- Many test files in the root directory
- Configuration files spread across the codebase
- No clear separation between frontend and backend code
- Difficult to navigate folder structure

## After
The project has been reorganized into a clean, maintainable structure:

```
/src
  /frontend         # React frontend application
  /backend          # Express backend application
  /config           # Configuration files
  /scripts          # Utility scripts
  /utils            # Shared utilities
  /types            # Shared TypeScript types
  /tests            # Test files
  /assets           # Static assets
```

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Created a logical directory structure
   - Moved all frontend code to `/src/frontend`
   - Moved all backend code to `/src/backend`
   - Consolidated all test files to `/src/tests`
   - Created dedicated directories for config, scripts, utils, types, and assets

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated `package.json` scripts to point to the new structure
   - Updated `vite.config.ts` to use the new directory paths
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to include files from the new structure
   - Updated `tailwind.config.ts` to scan files in the new locations
   - Updated `drizzle.config.ts` to point to the new schema location

3. **Import Path Updates**
   - Updated import paths in key files to reflect the new structure
   - Created aliases in `vite.config.ts` for easier imports:
     - `@/*` for frontend files
     - `@shared/*` for utilities
     - `@assets/*` for static assets

4. **Documentation**
   - Created a new `README.md` explaining the project structure
   - Added this `REORGANIZATION.md` file to document the changes

## Benefits

1. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier to navigate codebase
   - Reduced cognitive load when working on different parts of the application

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Related files are grouped together
   - Clearer boundaries between frontend and backend
   - Easier to onboard new developers

3. **Scalability**
   - Structure supports future growth
   - Easy to add new features without cluttering the codebase
   - Clear patterns for where new code should be placed

## Verification
A test script was created at `src/scripts/test-structure.js` to verify the new structure. Run it with:

```bash
node src/scripts/test-structure.js
```
