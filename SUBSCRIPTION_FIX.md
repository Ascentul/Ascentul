# Subscription Detection Fix - Using Clerk's has() Method

## What We Fixed

Your subscription wasn't being detected after payment because we were trying to manually parse Clerk's metadata structure, which wasn't documented clearly. We switched to using Clerk's **official `has()` method** which is purpose-built for checking subscriptions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `useSubscription()` Hook (/src/hooks/useSubscription.ts)
**Before:**
- Manually parsing `publicMetadata.subscriptions`, `publicMetadata.billing.plan`, etc.
- Guessing at Clerk's internal structure

**After:**
- Using `has({ plan: 'premium_monthly' })`
- Official Clerk SDK method - guaranteed to work
- Note: This single plan includes both monthly AND annual billing options

### 2. Added Session Reload Logic
**Files Updated:**
- `/src/app/pricing/page.tsx`
- `/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`

**What it does:**
- When user returns from Clerk checkout, automatically calls `clerkUser.reload()`
- Forces fresh subscription data from Clerk servers
- Prevents page from showing stale "free plan" status

### 3. Server-Side Feature Gating Using `has()`
**File:** `/src/lib/subscription-server.ts`

Updated implementation:
```typescript
export async function checkPremiumAccess(): Promise<boolean> {
  const { has } = await auth()
  // Check the single plan that includes both monthly and annual billing
  return has({ plan: 'premium_monthly' })
}
```

## How Feature Gating Works Now

### Client-Side (Components)
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/ClerkAuthProvider'

function MyComponent() {
  const { hasPremium } = useAuth() // Uses has() under the hood

  return (
    <>
      {hasPremium ? (
        <PremiumFeature />
      ) : (
        <UpgradePrompt />
      )}
    </>
  )
}
```

### Server-Side (API Routes, Server Components)
```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function GET() {
  const { has } = await auth()

  // Check the single plan (includes both monthly and annual billing)
  if (!has({ plan: 'premium_monthly' })) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Premium required' }, { status: 403 })
  }

  // Proceed with premium feature
}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear your browser cache and cookies**
2. **Sign out and sign back in**
3. **Check the browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   [PricingPage] User session refreshed after payment
   [useSubscription] Plan check: { hasPremiumMonthly: true, ... }
   ```
4. **Go to `/onboarding`** - should skip plan selection and go to next step
5. **Go to `/pricing`** - should redirect to `/dashboard` (since you already have premium)

## Debug Checklist

If subscription still not detected:

### ✅ Check Clerk Dashboard Plans Match
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Billing → Plans
2. Ensure plan key is exactly: `premium_monthly`
3. This ONE plan should have both monthly and annual billing options enabled
4. Capitalization and spacing matter!

### ✅ Check Browser Console
Look for these log messages:
```
[useSubscription] Plan check: {
  hasPremium: true,          // Should be true if you subscribed
  isPremium: true,           // Should be true
  planType: 'premium_monthly'
}
```

### ✅ Verify Payment Completed
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users → Your Account
2. Look for subscription indicator
3. Check that payment went through in Stripe dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to your live environment
2. **Test the full payment flow**:
   - Sign up as new user
   - Go to /pricing
   - Click "Choose Monthly Plan"
   - Complete payment
   - Get redirected back
   - Should see premium features unlocked
3. **Configure Clerk webhook** (see CLAUDE.md for instructions)

## Key Points

✅ **All feature gating now uses Clerk's `has()` method**
✅ **Session auto-refreshes after payment**
✅ **Convex fields are display-only (synced via webhook)**
✅ **Clerk is the single source of truth**

## Still Having Issues?

If subscription still not detected after these changes:

1. **Open browser console** (`F12` or `Cmd+Option+I`)
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Look for the debug logs** starting with `[useSubscription]`
4. **Share a screenshot** of the console output

This will show us exactly what Clerk is returning!
