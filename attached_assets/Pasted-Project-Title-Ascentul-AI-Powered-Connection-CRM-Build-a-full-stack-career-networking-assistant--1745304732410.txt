Project Title: Ascentul – AI-Powered Connection CRM

Build a full-stack career networking assistant (mini-CRM) where users can log their professional contacts, track interactions, and use AI to manage networking follow-ups.

Core Purpose:
Help users build, maintain, and grow their professional network in one place. The system should intelligently suggest when to follow up, summarize meeting notes, and draft personalized messages using AI.
