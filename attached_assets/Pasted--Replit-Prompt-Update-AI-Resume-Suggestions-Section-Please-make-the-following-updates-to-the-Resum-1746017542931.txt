 Replit Prompt: Update AI Resume Suggestions Section

Please make the following updates to the Resume Studio > Optimize with AI tab:

1. 🔁 Swap Button Order & Styling:
Move the “Generate Resume” button to the left side, and give it primary (blue) styling.

Move the “Generate Suggestions” button to the right side, and give it secondary (white) styling.

2. ✏️ Update the H1:
Change the current heading "Get AI-Powered Resume Suggestions" to:
→ "Optimize Your Resume with AI"
(This aligns with the new button priority and gives clearer context.)

3. 🧪 Confirm Button Functionality:
Ensure the “Generate Resume” button still generates a fully optimized resume using the job description and user’s career data.

Ensure the “Generate Suggestions” button still shows tailored advice and keywords based on the job description.

Let me know once this is applied — I’ll help you iterate on the next step.

Here’s your Replit prompt to apply consistent styling to the Cover Letter cards, matching the style used for the Project Portfolio cards:

🛠 Replit Prompt: Match Cover Letter Card Styling to Project Portfolio Cards

Please update the UI for all Cover Letter cards to match the same styling used on the Project Portfolio cards, including:

✅ 1. Card Shadow & Floating Effect:
Apply the hover elevation effect used in the Project Portfolio cards (light box-shadow or "lift" effect on hover).

Ensure the transition is smooth and matches the animation timing used in the Project Portfolio.

✅ 2. Hover Styling:
Apply the same hover outline, background tint, or highlight behavior as Project Portfolio cards receive on hover.

✅ 3. Border Radius & Padding:
Match the border-radius and padding exactly so all cards across the platform feel visually unified.

✅ 4. Mobile & Responsive Behavior:
Confirm that this updated styling is responsive and mobile-friendly, just like it is on the Project Portfolio cards.
