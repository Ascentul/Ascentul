Hi Replit,

Thank you for implementing the last updates. I tested the Voice Practice feature, and here's what I’m seeing:

The AI asks the first question correctly.

The microphone captures my voice input.

However, after I answer, the AI does not respond based on my reply, and the conversation doesn't continue properly.

🛠️ Here’s what’s happening:
It seems that while the mic is recording and Whisper is transcribing my voice, the user’s answer is not correctly being fed back into the conversation history and resubmitted to OpenAI.

As a result, the AI cannot acknowledge or build on my answer — the loop breaks after the first AI message.

✅ Here's the correct behavior we need:
AI asks a question via voice.

User holds mic, answers by speaking.

System transcribes the user's voice → text.

System appends the new transcribed user message to the conversation history with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "Transcribed user answer here."
}
System sends the full conversation history (including the new user message) to OpenAI’s Chat Completions API:

System prompt (background + job description)

All previous user and assistant messages

Latest user response

AI analyzes the user's latest answer, generates the next reply.

AI's text response is sent to Text-to-Speech API.

AI's voice response is played back to the user.

Loop continues naturally.

📦 Specific Technical Checklist:
 After each voice transcription, append the transcription to conversationHistory as a "role": "user" message.

 Ensure every new API call to OpenAI includes:

The system prompt

The entire updated conversationHistory

 Only make the API call after the user finishes answering and transcription is complete.

 After getting the AI's response, append it to conversationHistory as a "role": "assistant" message.

 Stream the AI’s next response via TTS and play it back.

 Console.log (for temporary debugging) the conversation array right before each OpenAI call to confirm the latest user input is included.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log("Conversation being sent:", conversationHistory);
🔍 Current Suspected Issue:
Mic is recording and transcription is happening ✅

But transcription is not properly appended to the conversation memory or not being included in the next API call ❌

🎯 End Goal:
The Voice Practice feature should now behave exactly like this:

AI asks → user answers → AI listens and adapts → AI asks next → user answers → repeat.

True real-time conversational coaching experience.

Please update the flow accordingly and let me know when it's ready — excited to continue testing once the continuous conversation is working!

Thanks again for your work on this!

📢 (Optional: Debug Tip)
If helpful, you can simulate a full conversation manually first using a static conversation array, then swap it live once verified.

🧠 Bonus Note:
Once this flow is working, it will dramatically increase realism and make the Voice Interview Practice feel just like a real human mock interview.
