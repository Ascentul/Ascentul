🛠 Final Combined Replit Prompt (Updated for Asset Picker Flow)
yaml
Copy
Edit
Update the Application Tracker in React + TailwindCSS to improve how resumes and cover letters are selected and displayed when an application is marked as “Applied”.

---

🔹 1. When the user updates the status from “In Progress” → “Applied”:
- Trigger a modal titled “Which resume and cover letter did you use?”

- Inside the modal, show two sections:
  A. Resume Selection
  B. Cover Letter Selection

- Each section should:
  - Display a list of the user’s saved resumes or cover letters
  - For each asset:
    - Show file name or title
    - Preview first few lines (or metadata like date created)
    - Let user click to select (toggle highlight or radio style)
    - Only one can be selected at a time per section

- At the bottom of the modal:
  - ✅ “Confirm” button → saves selected resumeId + coverLetterId to the application
  - ❌ “Skip” button → sets values as null but marks application as applied

- Use Tailwind for styling:
  - Use grid or flex layout for the asset picker sections
  - Highlight selected asset with `ring-2 ring-blue-500` or similar
  - Modal: `bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-xl max-w-[640px] mx-auto`

---

🔹 2. In the “Details” tab of the application:
- Add a “Materials Used” section
- Show:
  - Resume: [fileName] (clickable to view or edit)
  - Cover Letter: [fileName] (clickable to view or edit)

- If none selected, display:
  - Resume: Not provided
  - Cover Letter: Not provided

- Clicking the resume or cover letter allows the user to re-open the selection modal to update their choice

---

🔹 3. Data structure:
Save this to the application object:
{
  status: "applied",
  resumeId: "res_001",
  resumeTitle: "MarketingManager_v3.pdf",
  coverLetterId: "cl_003",
  coverLetterTitle: "Spotify_CL.pdf"
}

If skipped:
{
  resumeId: null,
  coverLetterId: null
}

This flow ensures that users can clearly see their career assets, select them visually, and save them to each application with confidence.
