Switch Voice Practice to OpenAI Only (No Anthropic)
Please remove all Anthropic dependencies from the Voice Practice feature and rebuild it using only OpenAI’s APIs. The current Anthropic-based setup is causing unnecessary fallback behavior and complicates the architecture.

✅ 1. Replace Claude with OpenAI Assistants (GPT-4o)
Remove all use of ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, Claude, or related logic.

Replace the Claude logic in the generate-question and analyze-response endpoints with OpenAI’s Assistants API (preferred) or chat.completions using gpt-4o.

Example (if not using Assistants yet):

ts
Copy
Edit
const messages = [
  { role: 'system', content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: `I'm interviewing for the position of ${jobTitle} at ${company}. Here's the job description:\n\n${jobDescription}`
  }
];

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages,
  temperature: 0.7
});
Return response.choices[0].message.content as the interview question.

✅ 2. Update System Prompt for OpenAI
Use this prompt for all interview sessions:

ts
Copy
Edit
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are a $200/hour professional interview coach.

Your job is to simulate a mock interview. Ask one thoughtful, role-specific question based on the job title, company, and job description.

You should sound friendly, confident, and realistic — like a real human interviewer, not a chatbot. Avoid generic questions. Always greet the candidate first.
`;
✅ 3. Keep Using OpenAI Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Nova
Maintain Nova voice as the audio output after GPT-4o generates a question.

Ensure:

ts
Copy
Edit
voice: 'nova',
model: 'tts-1-hd'
And stream audio if possible for faster playback.

✅ 4. Eliminate All Mock and Fallback Logic
Delete all mock response logic or default fallback questions unless there is a true API failure.

If OpenAI fails, log the error clearly but do not use fake questions.

Add robust error logging:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.error("OpenAI error in generate-question:", error);
✅ 5. Update Client-Side to Match
In client/src/pages/VoicePractice.tsx, ensure:

ts
Copy
Edit
generateQuestion({
  jobTitle: selectedJob.title,
  company: selectedJob.companyName,
  jobDescription: selectedJob.description
});
✅ 6. Result
After this update, the AI should:

Start the interview with a human-sounding Nova voice

Use GPT-4o to generate smart, context-aware questions

Eliminate fallback mode and generic prompts

Feel like a real $200/hour interview coach

Please confirm once this rebuild is complete so I can begin testing.
