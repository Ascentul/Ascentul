Objective:
Fix the broken "Edit" functionality inside the Account Settings Profile so users can fully edit, update, and delete their core career data:

Work History

Education

Skills

Certifications

Career Summary

ðŸ“‹ Issues to Fix:
Edit buttons currently do not trigger any modal or inline edit view.

No visible form appears when clicking Edit.

No way to update or save changes once edits are made.

No ability to delete entries.

âœ… What Needs to Be Implemented:
1. Enable "Edit" Button Functionality

Expected Behavior	Technical Requirements
Clicking the Edit button opens an editable form for that specific data entry (Work History, Education, etc.).	Open a modal OR expand an inline edit form below the selected item.
Pre-fill the form fields with the existing saved data.	Load current values into input fields.
Allow users to modify fields and click "Save Changes" or "Cancel."	Two buttons inside modal or inline form.
Save changes to Supabase immediately after clicking "Save."	Call update mutation for that object by its ID.
2. Allow "Delete" Functionality

Expected Behavior	Technical Requirements
Clicking "Delete" prompts a confirmation modal ("Are you sure?").	Confirmation before removal to prevent accidental deletion.
If confirmed, delete the selected item from Supabase.	Delete by object ID (WorkHistoryID, EducationID, etc.).
Refresh list view dynamically (no page reload needed).	Frontend should reflect real-time removal.
3. Add "Add New" Functionality if Missing
Each section should allow adding new entries if the user has none.

Example:

"+ Add New Work History" â†’ opens a blank form to add a job.

âœ… Keep UX consistent between "Add New" and "Edit Existing."

ðŸ“‚ Data Handling:
Updates should use Supabase update() function by entry ID.

Deletions should use Supabase delete() by entry ID.

Insertions should use Supabase insert() linked to the correct authenticated userID.

âœ… Changes should trigger frontend re-render without needing page refresh.

ðŸŽ¨ UX Expectations:
Show clear visual feedback:

Loading spinner if saving takes longer than 1 second.

Toast notification after successful edit or delete.

Disable Save button during database transaction to prevent double-submission.

ðŸš€ Future Considerations (Optional):
Allow users to reorder skills, work history by drag-and-drop later.

Add "Copy to Resume" button (future integration with Resume Studio).

ðŸ›  Deliverables:
âœ… Edit button functional for each core section.
âœ… Pre-filled form fields when editing.
âœ… Save and update entries dynamically to Supabase.
âœ… Delete items cleanly with confirmation modal.
âœ… Frontend refreshes dynamically without full reload.
âœ… Consistent UX across Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications, Career Summary.

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Fix Matters:
Unlocks true "Career Profile" functionality.

Prepares Ascentulâ€™s platform to power Resume Studio, AI Coach, and Career Explorer modules.

Reduces user friction and increases profile completion rates.
