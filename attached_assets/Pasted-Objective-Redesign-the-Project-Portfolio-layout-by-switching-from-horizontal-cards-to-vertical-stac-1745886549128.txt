Objective:
Redesign the Project Portfolio layout by switching from horizontal cards to vertical stacked cards. Feature a larger project image at the top of each card, followed by project details underneath for a clean, modern portfolio look.

Layout Changes:

1. Vertical Card Structure
Each project card should follow this vertical order:

Project Image (top, full card width, larger than before)

Project Title (bold, larger font)

Metadata Row:

Badge for Project Type ("Personal", "Professional")

Date (e.g., "April 2025")

Short Description (truncated after 3–4 lines)

Optional "Read More" link if the description is long

Component Details:

Card Width:

On desktop: around 300px to 350px width

On mobile: full width, responsive

Project Image:

Full width of the card

Height around 180px–220px

object-fit: cover to maintain image aspect ratio and fill the container without distortion

Apply border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0 to match the card

Card Body (text area):

Padding inside: 16px

Title: bold, slightly larger than before

Metadata (badge + date): smaller, light gray color

Description: normal text, 3–4 lines max before truncating

"Read More" link in brand color (e.g., blue)

Card Shadow and Hover Effects:

Add subtle box-shadow on default

On hover: lift card slightly (scale(1.02)), and make shadow deeper

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
.project-card {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
.project-card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  cursor: pointer;
}
Cards Grid Layout:

Use a grid or flexbox layout

3 cards per row on desktop, 2 on tablets, 1 on mobile

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
.projects-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 24px;
}
Extra Touches (Optional but Recommended):

Add a slight fade-in animation on page load for the cards.

Allow card click to expand full project view in a modal later (future upgrade).

If no project image is uploaded, use the default placeholder, but size it the same as real images to avoid layout shifting.

Deliverable:
A Project Portfolio page with vertically stacked project cards, larger project images, and polished modern styling, fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
