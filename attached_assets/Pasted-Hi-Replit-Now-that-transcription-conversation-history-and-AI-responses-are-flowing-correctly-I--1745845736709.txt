Hi Replit,

Now that transcription, conversation history, and AI responses are flowing correctly, I‚Äôd like to upgrade the Voice Practice experience to feel more like a real human conversation.

üõ†Ô∏è Upgrades to Implement:
üé§ 1. Improve Voice Quality (Natural-Sounding Female Voice)
Update the OpenAI TTS (Text-to-Speech) settings:

Use the "tts-1-hd" model instead of "tts-1" if not already using it.

Set the voice parameter to one of OpenAI‚Äôs natural female-sounding voices like:

"nova" (more natural, friendly, expressive)

"shimmer" (friendly, articulate)

"onyx" (for a slightly deeper but still warm tone)

Example TTS API request:

Copy
Edit
{
  "model": "tts-1-hd",
  "input": "Your text here.",
  "voice": "nova",
  "response_format": "mp3"
}
‚úÖ Goal:
Voice sounds warm, smooth, expressive ‚Äî no robotic tone.

‚ö° 2. Speed Up Processing and Reduce Latency
Optimize the app to reduce delays between stages:

Preload or lazy-load OpenAI models and libraries during page load to avoid startup lag.

Start uploading audio while recording ends, not after button click.

Use streaming wherever possible:

Use OpenAI‚Äôs stream: true setting for Chat Completions to start receiving AI text before the full response finishes.

Buffer TTS playback slightly so audio can start playing after the first chunk is ready.

Optimize audio file size:

Compress or downsample the recorded audio slightly if needed (e.g., 16kHz mono instead of 44.1kHz stereo), to speed up upload.

UI Improvement:

Update status to "Transcribing..." immediately after recording stops, even before the Whisper response arrives ‚Äî so the user feels progress.

‚úÖ Goal:
Reduce post-recording processing delay to under 2 seconds where possible.

üß† 3. Make the AI Behave as Human-Like as Possible
Modify the System Prompt injected at the start of each session to include behavioral tuning:

New System Prompt Additions:

You are an AI Interview Coach. Your mission is to behave as closely to a real human coach as possible.

Speak naturally and conversationally.

Occasionally use natural filler phrases like "That's a great question," "Let me think about that," or "Alright, let's move on."

Vary your sentence structure ‚Äî avoid overly formal or robotic patterns.

Adjust your pace: don't rush, but don't feel mechanical.

If appropriate, add small human touches (e.g., "Take a deep breath before you answer!" or "You're doing great ‚Äî let's try another one.").

Maintain a supportive, encouraging tone throughout.

Your user is practicing for a real-world job interview and deserves natural, helpful feedback.
‚úÖ Goal:
AI feels alive, empathetic, supportive ‚Äî not robotic or repetitive.

üñ•Ô∏è Additional Notes:
Voice Choice: Default to "nova" or "shimmer", but optionally allow user voice selection in future versions.

Streaming Chat: Focus on speeding up first byte to user, not just whole response.

Session Smoothness: Reduce UI loading or awkward waiting gaps as much as possible.

üéØ Success Criteria:
Voice is natural and pleasant, not robotic.

Processing between stages is significantly faster.

AI responses feel dynamic, human, and conversational ‚Äî not machine-like.

Whole experience feels like speaking to a real coach, not just a bot.

Thanks again ‚Äî this will bring the Voice Interview Practice feature up to top-tier quality!
