🛠️ Objective: Improve the “Generate Cover Letter Content” UI for clarity, responsiveness, and user feedback. The goal is to make the AI content generation experience feel polished, reliable, and easy to use — matching the UX of the Resume and Cover Letter Analyzers.

✅ Tasks to Implement:
1. Add Loading States to Buttons
On clicking Generate Full Letter or Get Suggestions:

Disable the button and show a spinner

Button text should update to:

Generating... or Getting Suggestions...

2. Update Right Panel with Loading Feedback
While waiting for AI output, show a loading animation or message inside the AI-Generated Content card:

css
Copy
Edit
"Creating tailored content based on your input..."
Optional: Use shimmer/skeleton or animated dots

3. Display and Style AI Output
Once AI returns content:

Display the result in a styled text block

Format it cleanly with readable line spacing

Add utility buttons below the AI result:

📋 Copy to Clipboard

💾 Save as Draft (optional)

🔄 Regenerate (optional)

4. Clarify Button Purpose
Add helper text below each button or as a tooltip:

Generate Full Letter: “Creates a complete AI-generated cover letter based on your job details.”

Get Suggestions: “Get writing prompts or paragraphs to inspire your own letter.”

5. Responsive Layout
Ensure mobile support:

Stack left and right panels vertically on smaller screens (flex-col md:flex-row)

Maintain adequate spacing and padding between sections

6. Optional Enhancement (if time allows):
Show a live preview header like:

“Now generating a cover letter for Marketing Manager at Acme Inc.”

✅ Design Consistency:
Match spacing, fonts, and card styling with the Resume Analyzer

Use Tailwind or your existing design system

Keep overall interaction smooth and trustworthy

Once implemented, this will complete the Cover Letter Generator UX and bring it fully in line with the rest of the platform. Let me know if you'd like the AI prompt upgraded next!
