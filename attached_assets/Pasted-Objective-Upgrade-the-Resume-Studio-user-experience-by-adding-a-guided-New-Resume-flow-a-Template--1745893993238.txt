Objective:
Upgrade the Resume Studio user experience by adding a guided New Resume flow, a Template Type filtering system, and polishing the Edit Resume template gallery integration â€” matching the best standards in SaaS resume builders (Enhancv, Resume.io, etc.).

ðŸ“‹ Scope of Updates:
1. Update "New Resume" Flow (Guided Creation)
When a user clicks "New Resume" from the dashboard:

Open a 2-step modal flow (NOT drop straight into Edit Resume).


Step	Details
Step 1	Show "Choose Resume Style" (Modern, Traditional, Simple, Creative) â€” 4 filter buttons, visually styled like the provided design (colored icons + text).
Step 2	Show Template Gallery grid filtered by selected Style/Type. (Small thumbnails of templates.)
On Selection	After user picks a template â†’ Launch Edit Resume screen with selected template pre-applied.
Allow Back button between steps.

âœ… Smooth, premium feeling.
âœ… Sets the tone for their whole editing experience.

2. Add Template Types as Filters in Edit Resume
Add a "Templates" tab inside Edit Resume modal/page (already partly structured).

Inside the Templates tab:

Show the same Resume Style Filters (Modern, Traditional, Simple, Creative) above the gallery.

Clicking a style filter narrows down the templates shown dynamically.

Default behavior = "Show All" if no style selected.

âœ… Lets users browse and switch templates easily later.

3. Polish Template Styling (Classic, Minimal, Professional, Modern)
Fine-tune each templateâ€™s layout for professional polish:


Element	Update
Name Header	Slightly larger, bold.
Contact Info	Smaller font, clean separators (use dot â€¢ or pipe
Section Titles	Bold, slight spacing above. (Minimal template = lowercase/lighter.)
Section Spacing	Tighten vertical gaps (make it look more compact like real resumes).
Skill Pills	Decrease margin between pills (they should cluster cleanly).
Dates	Format dates as "Dec 2023 â€“ Present" (Month Year format) instead of "12/05/23 - Present".
Dividers	Add subtle horizontal lines between sections in Classic and Professional templates.
Bullet Styling	Keep bullets simple (â€¢) and cleanly aligned under Experience.
âœ… Makes each resume look ready for real-world professional use.

4. Download = True WYSIWYG
Ensure when user downloads PDF, it matches the preview exactly:

Fonts

Section spacing

Colors

Margins

âœ… Trust-building, no surprises when downloading.

5. Responsiveness and Mobile Support
Ensure New Resume modal, Template selection gallery, and Edit Resume page are fully responsive:

Resume Preview scales nicely on desktop/tablet/mobile.

Filter buttons and thumbnails adjust without layout breakage.

âœ… Modern UX expectations.

ðŸ›  Deliverables:
âœ… Clicking "New Resume" triggers a beautiful 2-step guided flow.
âœ… Resume Types (Modern, Traditional, Simple, Creative) are integrated visually.
âœ… Templates filtered by type, selectable by thumbnails.
âœ… Polished templates ready for production (professional layouts).
âœ… Downloaded PDFs exactly match on-screen preview (WYSIWYG).
âœ… Mobile-friendly throughout.

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Upgrade Matters:
Instantly improves first impressions for users.

Reduces friction during resume creation.

Sets Ascentul up for Premium Template monetization later.

Matches and beats UX of major competitors (Enhancv, Zety, Resume.io).
