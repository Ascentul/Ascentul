Strategy-Powered Smart Daily Recommendations (Career Coaching Layer)
Update the existing Smart Daily Recommendations system to incorporate career coaching best practices, strategic event triggers, and non-obvious behavioral logic. The system should generate 5 deeply personalized recommendations per user, per day — functioning as a proactive, intelligent career assistant.

🔁 Functional Requirements
1. Generate 5 Daily Recommendations per User
Triggered every 24 hours via backend cron or login

Each rec should be:

Personalized

Contextual

Strategically useful

Stored in the existing daily_recommendations model

Recs should be checkable (isCompleted: boolean), persist through the day, and refresh cleanly every 24h

🧠 Add Career Strategy Intelligence
🔁 Event-Based Coaching Triggers:
Add smart logic that monitors user timeline events and schedules matching recommendations. For example:

Trigger	Recommendation
🗓️ Day after an interview	“Send a thank-you or follow-up email to [Contact Name] to stay top-of-mind.”
🕓 3–5 days after no interview response	“No word from [Company]? Send a brief check-in — timing is key.”
📬 App submitted 7+ days ago	“This application is going cold — consider reaching out on LinkedIn.”
✅ Goal completed	“Celebrate progress! Reflect on what worked and set your next goal.”
❌ Rejection received	“You’re not alone. Review what you learned and set a follow-up plan.”

🧭 Add Non-Obvious Strategic Recommendations:
Based on less-visible but high-leverage data patterns, surface smart suggestions like:

Context	Recommendation
❓ No job target in profile	“You're applying blind. Define your target role to focus your efforts.”
📄 Resume uploaded, no AI scan	“Let’s scan your resume for red flags — 5 minutes now saves you weeks later.”
🕸️ No networking activity	“Only applying online? Reach out to 1 contact today — it's 10x more effective.”
📉 Low weekly activity	“Career momentum matters. 3 small actions > 1 perfect one.”
📂 Same industry in all apps	“Your job search is narrow. Diversify by applying to a different sector this week.”
🧑‍💻 No work/project history	“No experience listed? Even volunteer projects help build trust.”
🧠 Pattern of stalling at follow-up	“You’re consistently not following up. Try batching them each Friday.”
📌 Too many goals at once	“You're juggling too much. Focus on just 1 goal this week for faster progress.”
🧾 No achievements logged	“Hiring managers want impact — add 2 measurable wins to your resume.”

🔬 Coaching-Level Personalization Logic
Incorporate deeper logic to guide the system:

Pattern Detection:

Repeated ghosting → recommend “follow-up + diversify outreach”

Multiple rejections → suggest resume optimization

Stalling out at the same stage → recommend targeted action (e.g. mock interview)

Intent Modeling:

User sets goals and applies, but never follows up → recommend confidence-building micro actions

Balance Checks:

Too much applying, no networking → suggest 70/30 rule strategy split

Heavy on goal setting, no task completions → recommend 1-task focus prompt

🔧 Implementation Requirements
Add new logic layer on top of current generator

Use event dates (e.g. interviewDate, applicationDate, followUpDueDate) and behavior logs to trigger coaching rules

Pull from a growing recommendation prompt library organized by category (interview, followup, profile, strategy, etc.)

For each daily batch of 5:

Prioritize urgency and variety

Limit to 1–2 per category per day

Backfill with proactive or reflection-based suggestions if needed

Store and display recommendations in the UI as a checklist

Checkbox updates isCompleted

Visual state fades/strikes through checked items

Order does not change when checked

⚠️ Final Notes
This system must behave like a real-time, data-aware career coach — not a static task list. All recs should reflect behavior, timing, and best practices in modern career development. Nothing should be hardcoded or purely generic.
