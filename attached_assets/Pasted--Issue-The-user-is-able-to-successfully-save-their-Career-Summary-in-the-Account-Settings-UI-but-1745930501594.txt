🔧 Issue:
The user is able to successfully save their Career Summary in the Account Settings UI, but the saved data is not being displayed afterward.

🧠 Likely Root Cause:
The frontend is not retrieving the Career Summary value from Supabase after saving.

The component may not be:

Calling refetch() or invalidateQueries()

Reading from the correct query key

Properly rendering the returned value in the CareerSummary component

✅ Action Steps:
Ensure Career Summary is Queried on Load

In the component (CareerSummary.tsx or equivalent), fetch the user’s career_summary from Supabase on load using a hook like useCareerData() or useProfile().

tsx
Copy
Edit
const { data } = useQuery(['careerData'], getQueryFn());
Render Saved Summary if It Exists

In place of the “No career summary added yet” state, show the saved summary if data?.career_summary exists.

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (careerSummary) {
  return <p>{careerSummary}</p>;
}
Refetch Data on Save

After the user submits a new summary, call:

tsx
Copy
Edit
queryClient.invalidateQueries('careerData');
This ensures the newly saved summary is available for re-render.

Optional: Add Toast or Success Feedback

After successful save, display:

tsx
Copy
Edit
showToast("Career Summary saved successfully ✅");
💾 Supabase Schema Reminder:
Make sure the career_summary is:

Stored in the correct table (profiles, users, or career_data)

Queried correctly via the user_id

✨ Bonus Improvements (UI Polish Suggestions)
✅ What's Working Well:
Progress Indicator is clear, motivating, and aligns with profile completeness strategy.

"Add Summary" call-to-action is well placed and explains why this field matters.

"Synced to Resume" tag on work history = 🔥. Reinforces the product’s intelligence.

🧠 Suggested UI Improvements:

Area	Suggestion	Why
Career Summary Display	When saved, format it like a paragraph with proper line height (not just <p>{text}</p>), and add an "Edit" button top-right	Improves readability, reduces visual clutter
Section Header UX	Consider adding a checkmark next to filled sections (✔ Career Summary, ✔ Work History)	Reinforces progress visually
Add Summary Button	After data is added, change + Add Career Summary to ✏️ Edit Summary	Prevents confusion about whether it's saved or not
Auto-Save Notice (optional)	Add a small line: “Your changes are saved automatically.”	Improves trust and clarity in real-time updates
🚀 Final Deliverables:
 Display the saved Career Summary text when present.

 Allow users to re-edit their summary.

 Invalidate and refetch data after save.

 Clean visual rendering of summary content.

 UI toggle between “Add” vs “Edit” based on whether summary exists.
