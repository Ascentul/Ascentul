Voice Practice Recovery Mode Issue
üìçProblem
We're getting this error every time we start a Voice Practice session:

Recovery mode active
Using backup question due to API error. You can continue the interview.

This means the OpenAI call to generate interview questions is failing, and the app is falling back to mock data.

‚úÖ What We Need You To Do
1. Check Environment Variable Setup
Confirm OPENAI_API_KEY is set and loaded correctly in the backend where the OpenAI call is made.

Print/log process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY temporarily in openai.ts to verify it exists.

2. Log Full OpenAI API Error
Inside the generateInterviewQuestion, manageInterviewThread, or similar function, wrap the API call in a try/catch and log the entire error object:

ts
Copy
Edit
try {
  const run = await openai.beta.threads.createRun(...);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('OpenAI API Error:', {
    message: error.message,
    response: error.response?.data,
    status: error.response?.status
  });
}
This will tell us exactly why it‚Äôs falling back.

3. Verify Assistant & Thread Flow
Ensure the assistant is created before the thread is run.

Validate assistant_id, thread_id, and run logic ‚Äî are they being passed and resolved correctly?

4. Simplify the Prompt to Rule Out Prompt Errors
Test with a minimal, valid job description and role.

Check if the run instruction or system prompt has special characters or excessive length that could cause failure.

5. Confirm TTS & Transcription Are Separated
Voice-related APIs (text-to-speech and transcription) are working, but this issue is about the generate-interview-question route, which uses OpenAI Assistants or Chat Completion API.

üí° Bonus: Add a Server Log When Fallback Triggers
In server/routes/interview-voice.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (isFallbackTriggered) {
  console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Using fallback question due to OpenAI API failure.");
}
üì¶ Recap
 Log OpenAI error response (error.response.data)

 Confirm OPENAI_API_KEY is loading

 Verify assistant + thread flow

 Sanitize and test with minimal prompt

 Add warning log when fallback is triggered
