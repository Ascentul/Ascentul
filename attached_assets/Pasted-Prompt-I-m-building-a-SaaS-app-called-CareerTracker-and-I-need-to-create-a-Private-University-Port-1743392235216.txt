Prompt:
I’m building a SaaS app called CareerTracker, and I need to create a Private University Portal + Invite-Only Sign Up Flow to support university partnerships.
Here’s what I need you to build:
🔐 1. Private University Sign-Up & Login Page
Create a new route/page at /university with its own layout (use Tailwind or clean CSS).
Include:
School-branded welcome message (placeholder for logo/school name).
Email field for sign-up (restricted to pre-approved domains like @northpark.edu).
Password + confirm password field.
Option to paste a university invite code (optional).
Toggle for "I’m a Student" or "I’m an Admin".
Link to university login if the user already has an account.
📄 2. Backend Functionality
Create a basic user model with:
fullName, email, password, universityId, role (student/admin), isUniversityAccount, invited boolean
Create a university model:
universityId, name, domainWhitelist (array of allowed email domains), logoUrl, adminUsers
Implement:
Domain-based validation (if user signs up with @northpark.edu, auto-link to universityId)
Invite code logic (if code is used, associate user with correct university)
Prevent registration unless domain matches or invite is valid
📬 3. Invite System (Admin Flow)
Create an endpoint or admin dashboard (mock is fine) to:
Generate invite codes for a university
Upload a CSV of student emails to invite in bulk
Track which invites were redeemed
🔄 4. Link to Regular Signup Page
On the main signup form, remove “University” as a visible toggle.
Instead, under “Create Account,” add this text:
“Are you a university student in a partner program? Access your portal here”
💾 Bonus (Optional)
Create a simple UI to switch to /university/northpark or /university/:slug if multiple school-specific landing pages are needed later.
Store universityId in the user session to control dashboard access and content.
Keep the structure clean and scalable. You can use basic mock data for universities and show conditional content based on isUniversityAccount.
