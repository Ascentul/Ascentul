Create a feature called Apply that lets users apply to jobs directly inside Ascentul. The experience should feel like an elegant, AI-assisted wizard — the user simply approves, revises, or lets the AI complete the application step-by-step. It should all happen inline, below the job listing they clicked on, without leaving the app.

🧩 SECTION 1: Core Workflow
🔍 Job Listing Flow
Users browse jobs in a standard job search interface (already implemented or pulling from job APIs like Adzuna, Remotive, or JSearch)

Each job card includes:

Job Title, Company, Location

Tags (Remote, Contract, etc.)

[🔵 Apply] button

When the user clicks Apply, an application drawer appears inline below that job card.

🧙 SECTION 2: Apply Panel (Application Agent UI)
Layout:
Left or top pane: Embedded job application page via iframe or webview

Right or side panel (or floating): AI Wizard Assistant UI

AI Wizard Flow:
For each form field detected on the application page:

AI Agent reads the field label

Auto-fills using user data (name, email, resume, cover letter, etc.)

Displays prompt:

text
Copy
Edit
We filled in the "Why do you want this role?" field with:

"I’m passionate about using data to drive creative product decisions and would love to contribute to CloudMasonry’s mission."

✅ Yes, continue    ✍️ Edit manually    ♻️ Re-do with AI
On Yes → Agent clicks “Next” or scrolls to the next field

On Edit manually → Enable that field for user input only

On Re-do with AI → Call OpenAI again with modified logic

🧠 SECTION 3: AI Intelligence
User Data Mapping
Pull the following data from the user’s account:

Full name, email, phone

Resume(s)

Cover letter(s)

LinkedIn / portfolio

Career goal(s)

Work history, achievements, education

AI Prompts (Use GPT-4 or function-calling)
Generate answers for open text questions:

“Why do you want this job?”

“Describe a time you handled X”

Match the best resume/cover letter based on job title and keywords

Resume/Cover Letter Selection

✅ SECTION 4: Final Review + Submission
At the end of the form:
