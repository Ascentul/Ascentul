Goal: Revamp the sidebar to have four main sections, each containing relevant features. When a user clicks on a section, a smooth flyout animation opens with the features for that category. Maintain a clean and organized UI with a professional, smooth experience like Apple/Notion design.

üß† Additional Functionality:
Flyout Animation: When a section is clicked, the flyout should smoothly transition into view. The section should highlight, then smoothly expand to show the respective features.

Ensure that the flyout animation is smooth, subtle, and non-distracting, similar to the Apple/Notion style.

Persistent Sidebar: When any section is selected, it should remain expanded, giving easy access to the sub-tools under that category. Optionally, the sub-tool names can be collapsible to reduce clutter.

Icons for Categories: Each section should have a clean, intuitive icon (e.g., a briefcase for ‚ÄúJob Search,‚Äù a graph for ‚ÄúCareer Growth,‚Äù etc.) to visually differentiate the categories.

Responsive Design: The flyout should be responsive, looking great on both desktop and mobile views. On smaller screens, it can condense into a ‚Äúdrawer-style‚Äù menu that expands when clicked.
