Smart Daily Recommendations (5 per day, checkable assistant)
Implement a Smart Recommendation System that delivers 5 personalized, high-value recommendations per user per day, based on their complete, real-time app data. These recommendations should appear in the “Today’s Recommendations” module and function like a checkable personal assistant.

🔁 Functional Requirements
1. Generate 5 Recommendations Per Day
Run once per user every 24 hours

Triggered by:

Backend cron job

Or user login (only if cron hasn't triggered yet)

2. Pull From These Data Sources:
Career Profile

Missing target role, experience, resume, skills, education

Career Goals

Status (not started, in progress), task completion, inactivity

Interview Stages

Scheduled interviews, overdue interviews, prep status

Follow-Up Actions

Overdue or upcoming follow-ups:

From contacts (networking/referral-based)

From interviews (thank you emails, check-ins)

Active Applications

Stage (e.g. “applied” with no follow-up in X days)

3. Priority Logic
Prioritize by urgency:

Interview prep (upcoming within 48h)

Overdue follow-up actions

Stalled or incomplete goals

Profile gaps

Momentum boosters (networking, journaling, skills)

Limit to 1–2 recommendations per category

If fewer than 5 active triggers, backfill with proactive suggestions

🧾 Recommendation Format & Storage
Each recommendation should follow this schema:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  date: string, // e.g., "2025-05-08"
  text: string, // e.g., "📅 You have an interview tomorrow at Cortex Labs..."
  category: "goal" | "profile" | "interview" | "followup" | "application" | "growth",
  isCompleted: boolean
}
Store these in a daily_recommendations table or per-user object

Overwrite the previous day’s recommendations on refresh

Mark individual recs as isCompleted when checked by the user

✅ UI Display Requirements
Render the 5 daily recommendations in a checklist format

For each:

Checkbox to toggle isCompleted

Recommendation text

Optional:

Icon prefix or category badge (e.g., 📅, ✅, ✉️, 🧠)

Inline link to relevant section (e.g., “View Goal”, “Edit Resume”)

Visual treatment:

Strike-through or faded style when checked

Do not reorder list on check-off

🔁 Refresh Logic
Refresh recs once every 24 hours per user

Auto-refresh via scheduled cron or silent login trigger

Store state persistently in DB to avoid reloading new recs mid-day

Manual refresh button (e.g., 🔁) may be exposed in dev only, hidden in production

⚠️ System Behavior Notes
This module must feel like an intelligent career assistant

All logic must dynamically adapt to the user's live app state — no static or hardcoded tasks

This is a UX + logic layer on top of the user’s profile, goals, interviews, applications, and follow-up data
