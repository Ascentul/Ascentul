 Objective:
Fix and fully enable the Account Settings Profile Editor to allow users to add, edit, update, and delete entries in these sections:

Work History

Education

Skills

Certifications

(Also prepare to add Career Summary block next.)

🧩 Issues to Fix:
The current "Edit" buttons are non-functional.

No modals or forms appear to edit or add data.

There is no ability to delete items once added.

✅ What Needs to Be Implemented:
For each of the following profile sections — implement full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

1. Work History

Field	Type
Job Title	Text
Company	Text
Start Date	Date Picker
End Date (or toggle: Present)	Date Picker
Description	Multi-line Text
Functionality:

Add New

Edit Existing

Delete Entry

Save/Cancel buttons

Real-time updates in UI

2. Education

Field	Type
School Name	Text
Degree/Program	Text
Start Date	Date Picker
End Date	Date Picker
Description	Optional Text
Same functionality: Add / Edit / Delete / Save / Cancel

3. Skills
Multi-select chip input (e.g., React, Marketing Strategy, Project Management)

Allow free text or select from preset tags

✅ Add / Remove chips
✅ Allow reordering or prioritization later (optional)

4. Certifications

Field	Type
Certification Name	Text
Issued By	Text
Date Earned	Date Picker
Certificate URL (optional)	URL
✅ Add / Edit / Delete

5. Add Career Summary Block (NEW)

Field	Type
Summary Text	Rich Text Area (max 750 characters)
✅ Simple "Edit Summary" toggle
✅ Save / Cancel functionality
✅ Display preview version by default

🔁 Data Handling:
All entries must be saved to Supabase under the authenticated user ID.

Any updates should reflect immediately in the frontend without page refresh.

Validation: Ensure required fields are filled before allowing save.

Protect against accidental deletions with confirmation modal ("Are you sure you want to delete this entry?")

🎨 UI Behavior:
"Edit" buttons open modals or inline edit views (consistent with Resume Studio UX).

Each section should clearly show added entries with visual hierarchy (title > subtitle > description).

Show "Add +" button when there are no entries, or at the bottom of each section.

🚀 Future Readiness:
Ensure this profile data is structured to be easily pulled into:

Resume Studio

AI Coach

Voice Interview Practice

Career Path Explorer

✅ This Account Settings module becomes the master data layer for personalization and automation.

🧪 Testing:
Add at least 1 entry in each section.

Update an existing item, confirm changes saved to DB and re-rendered.

Delete an item and confirm DB + UI removal.

Check for proper validation, user feedback, and error states.

📌 Notes:
All form logic and Supabase mutations should use existing auth/session context.

Optional: Add a toast message after successful update ("Work History updated!").

✅ Deliverables:
Fully functional Account Settings editor for all profile sections.

Clean, responsive UX across all CRUD actions.

Synced to backend Supabase database.

Clear error handling and feedback for users.

Once this is functional, we can proceed with:

Enabling Resume Studio to pull from profile

Adding "Sync to Profile" toggle on resume edits
