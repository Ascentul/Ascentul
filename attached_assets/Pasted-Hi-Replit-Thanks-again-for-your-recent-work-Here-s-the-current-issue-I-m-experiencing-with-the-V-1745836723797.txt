Hi Replit,

Thanks again for your recent work.

Here‚Äôs the current issue I‚Äôm experiencing with the Voice Interview Practice feature:

I can hit the Record button and then click Complete Response.

However:

I do not see my speech being transcribed into text (no visual confirmation of transcription).

There is no evidence that my spoken response is captured, stored, or passed along to the AI.

After clicking Complete Response, the AI does not respond to what I said ‚Äî the conversation doesn't continue based on my answer.

üîç Request: Please Act as Technical Architect
I‚Äôd like you to step back and function as a technical architect for a moment ‚Äî and analyze the full flow and diagnose what‚Äôs missing or broken.

Questions to answer:

Is the microphone input properly capturing audio when I hit Record?

Is the audio recording properly sent to OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper (Speech-to-Text) API for transcription?

Are we receiving a valid transcription response back?

Is the transcription being correctly appended to the conversation history?

After transcription, are we sending a full updated conversation to OpenAI‚Äôs Chat Completions API?

Are we receiving the AI's response?

Is the AI response converted into audio and played back successfully?

üß© Key Points to Investigate:
 Is the microphone capture working (recording audio) at all?

 Is the recorded audio correctly formatted and sent to the Whisper API endpoint?

 Are we handling the Whisper API response properly? (Is transcription being parsed and saved?)

 Are we appending the user's transcription to the conversation history as a "role": "user" message?

 Is the conversation history properly sent back to OpenAI for AI to respond?

 Are there any silent API errors during Whisper transcription or Chat completion?

 Are there missing event triggers (e.g., submitting user response not triggering the next AI turn)?

 Are there missing UI updates (no "Your response was captured" feedback)?

 Are CORS issues, audio format problems, or size limits affecting uploads?

üõ†Ô∏è Deliverable
Please approach this methodically:

Outline where you believe the flow is broken.

Recommend a structured plan to fix it.

If possible, propose a small debugging/logging strategy we can temporarily use to confirm each step (e.g., logs after recording, after transcription, after sending user message).

üéØ Success Criteria
After the fix:

I should see a live transcription of my spoken response.

My transcribed answer should be submitted to the AI.

The AI should respond based on my actual answer, not stay idle.

The conversation should continue naturally.

Thanks again ‚Äî I appreciate you stepping into the architect role on this so we can build this feature as a true high-quality real-time AI experience!
