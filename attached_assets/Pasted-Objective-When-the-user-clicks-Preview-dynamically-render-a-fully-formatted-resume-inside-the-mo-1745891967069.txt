Objective:
When the user clicks "Preview," dynamically render a fully formatted resume inside the modal, using all fields entered in the Resume Editor, styled according to the selected template, and optimized automatically by AI for clean layout and fitting.

ðŸ“„ Changes Required:
1. Dynamically Render Full Resume Content
Pull data from all the input sections:

Personal Info: Full Name, Email, Phone, LinkedIn, Location, Portfolio Website

Summary: Professional Summary or Objective

Skills: List of key skills

Experience: Job titles, companies, dates, descriptions

Education: Schools, degrees, dates

Projects: Project names, descriptions (if included)

Structure it visually exactly like a real resume would look:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Name
Location | Email | Phone | LinkedIn | Portfolio
---
Professional Summary
---
Skills
---
Experience
---
Education
---
Projects (optional)
2. Apply Selected Template Styling
Format resume dynamically based on the chosen template (Standard, Modern, etc.).

Control:

Font size

Line spacing

Section headers

Margins

Bullet points

Different templates should have slightly different visual appearances (modern vs classic layouts).

3. AI Formatting Optimizations
Before rendering:

Balance font sizes dynamically depending on content length.

Adjust margins and spacing to prevent cutting off sections.

Auto-wrap text where needed for clean one-page or two-page max layouts.

If short content (e.g., minimal experience), rebalance to avoid awkward white space.

4. Scrollable and Zoomable Modal
If the resume height exceeds the modal viewport:

Enable vertical scrolling inside the modal.

Zoom controls (existing) should now actually zoom the resume content.

Ensure zoom resets smoothly without breaking formatting.

5. Keep Download PDF Available
User can download the formatted resume exactly as they see it after previewing.

Clicking "Download PDF" should save the current visual version.

6. Add Light Loading State (Optional)
If resume rendering takes longer than 0.5s:

Show a simple spinner with text:

"Loading your resume preview..."

ðŸ“‚ Technical Notes:
Use HTML + CSS to render the resume inside the modal for real-time viewing.

Do not force users to download a PDF just to see the result.

The preview should match the final download exactly (WYSIWYG principle: What You See Is What You Get).

ðŸ›  Deliverable:
âœ… Full resume preview rendered dynamically from all resume fields.
âœ… Matches selected template formatting.
âœ… AI adjusts formatting for clean, professional look.
âœ… Scrollable and zoomable inside modal.
âœ… Download PDF option available after preview.

ðŸ§  Why This Matters:
âœ… Builds immediate user trust.
âœ… Reduces friction (no guessing if resume looks good).
âœ… Matches UX expectations from top SaaS apps like Canva, Google Docs, Notion.
âœ… Supports long-term scaling to multiple templates and resume versions.
