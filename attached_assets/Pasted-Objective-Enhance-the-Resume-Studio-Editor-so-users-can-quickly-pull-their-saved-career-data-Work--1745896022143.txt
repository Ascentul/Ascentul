Objective:
Enhance the Resume Studio Editor so users can quickly pull their saved career data (Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications, Career Summary) into a new or existing resume, reducing friction and speeding up resume creation.

ðŸ“‹ Changes to Implement:
1. Pull User's Saved Profile Data
Pull the following from Account Settings:

Work History (job titles, companies, dates, descriptions)

Education (schools, degrees, dates)

Skills (skills tags/keywords)

Certifications (certifications name, authority, date earned)

Career Summary (short professional summary or objective)

âœ… Pull data cleanly from the backend (Supabase or other DB) associated with the user's account.

2. Insert "Add from Saved Info" Buttons Inside Resume Editor
In the "Create Resume" and "Edit Resume" forms:


Resume Tab	Action to Add
Personal/Professional Summary Tab	Add "Insert Saved Career Summary" button
Skills Tab	Add "+ Add from Saved Skills" multi-select option
Work Experience Tab	Add "+ Add from Saved Work History" button
Education Tab	Add "+ Add from Saved Education" button
Certifications Tab	Add "+ Add from Saved Certifications" button
âœ… Clicking any of these buttons opens a modal or dropdown that shows the saved entries available.
âœ… Users can select one or more items to insert into the current resume theyâ€™re building.

3. Editing Behavior After Inserting
Imported fields should be fully editable immediately.

Edits made inside the resume form do not update the original saved profile data.

Resumes should act as independent documents once the data is pulled in.

âœ… No conflicts with master data.
âœ… Full flexibility for resume customization.

4. Handle Edge Cases
If no saved entries exist for a category (e.g., no saved skills yet):

Show a friendly message:

"No saved [Skills/Work History/Education] yet. Add your career information in Account Settings to use this feature!"

(Optional) Provide a link "Go to Account Settings" to quickly add saved info.

âœ… Smooth fallback UX without dead ends.

5. Save Behavior
When the user clicks "Create Resume" or "Update Resume," the resume saves exactly what is shown in the editor â€” including any inserted saved data.

The saved resume is independent of any future changes made to Account Settings.

âœ… Resumes are locked snapshots once saved.

ðŸ“‚ Technical Requirements:
Resume editor must dynamically load saved information via API or database fetch.

Inserted content must fit into the existing resume JSON/data structure for consistency.

Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile.

ðŸ›  Deliverables:
âœ… Saved Info Picker buttons implemented across relevant resume sections.
âœ… Modal or dropdown select UX for picking saved info.
âœ… Seamless editable insertion.
âœ… Fallback handling for users with no saved data.
âœ… Full save behavior integration.

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Feature Matters:
Speeds up resume creation dramatically (first value moment = higher retention).

Makes Ascentul feel personalized, premium, and user-centered.

Sets foundation for future "Smart Resume" AI features.

Increases user lock-in by tying usersâ€™ career history to your system.
