🎯 Objective:
Ensure visual consistency across all “Add” buttons in the Career tab of Account Settings by aligning size, padding, icon placement, and label structure. This improves the polish, professionalism, and user clarity of the UI.

📋 Current Inconsistencies:

Section	Label	Icon	Size/Style Issues
Career Summary	Add	✏️	Smaller, no icon alignment
Work History	+ Add Job	➕	Medium, consistent
Education	+ Add Education	➕	Medium, consistent
✅ Action Steps:
1. Create a Shared AddSectionButton Component
This reusable component should:

Use a + icon left of the label (e.g. <PlusIcon />)

Have standardized padding and margin (px-4 py-2, or match tailwind token)

Accept a label prop (e.g., Add Job, Add Education)

Optional onClick prop for triggering section modals

Example:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<AddSectionButton label="Add Career Summary" onClick={handleClick} />
2. Apply Across All Sections
Replace the current inline buttons in:

Career Summary

Work History

Education

(Also Skills and Certifications if present)

✅ Each button should:

Use the same width and height (minimum touch target size: 44x44px)

Be styled identically with hover/focus states

Be right-aligned consistently at the top of each section OR centered in empty state containers (but consistently across sections)

3. Add Fallback Label Logic (Optional)
If a section has content, show:

✏️ Edit Career Summary

If empty, show:

+ Add Career Summary

You can determine this by checking if a corresponding Supabase entry exists.

🧪 QA Checklist:
 All Add buttons are visually the same size and use the + icon left of text

 Button text uses consistent structure (+ Add {Thing})

 Buttons behave consistently across all sections

 No layout shifts between sections during scroll

 Mobile responsive sizing is retained

🧠 Why This Matters:
Improves user trust and polish perception

Makes the product feel thoughtfully designed

Increases usability and accessibility

Supports long-term modular design (Resume Studio, AI Coach, etc.)
