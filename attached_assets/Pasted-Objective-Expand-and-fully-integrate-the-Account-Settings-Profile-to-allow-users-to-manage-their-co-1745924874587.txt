Objective:
Expand and fully integrate the Account Settings Profile to allow users to manage their core career data (Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications, Career Summary) â€”
and make sure this data powers all major Ascentul features (Resume Builder, AI Coach, Voice Interview Practice, Career Path Explorer).

ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Expand Account Settings Profile Fields
Inside Account Settings, allow users to view, add, edit, and delete the following:


Section	Fields
Work History	Job Title, Company, Start Date, End Date, Description
Education	School Name, Degree, Start Date, End Date, Description
Skills	Skill Tags (multi-entry, free-form text or dropdown select)
Certifications	Certificate Name, Issuing Authority, Date Earned
Career Summary	Professional Summary Text (short paragraph)
âœ… Each section should be editable individually.
âœ… Allow multiple entries where appropriate (e.g., multiple jobs, multiple degrees).

ðŸ“‹ Step 2: Power All Features Using Profile Data
Ensure the following modules access and pull from the updated Account Settings Profile:


Feature	Behavior
Resume Builder	Users can select/import Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications, and Career Summary into their resumes directly from their Profile.
AI Coach	AI uses Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications, Career Summary context to generate personalized coaching advice. (Example: career growth plans, job search strategies.)
Voice Interview Practice	Interview questions should dynamically reference user's Work History, Skills, Education to simulate real-world interviews. (e.g., "Tell me about your role at [Company].")
Career Path Explorer	Suggestions and career path visualizations are personalized based on Skills, Education, Work History.
âœ… Live sync: When users update their Profile, future suggestions/coaching automatically reflect the new info.

ðŸ“‹ Step 3: Data Sync Logic

Condition	System Behavior
User updates profile info	All new resume builds, AI coaching, and interview sessions pull updated data automatically.
User edits info directly inside Resume Builder (manual override)	Only that resume reflects the manual edits â€” the master Profile remains unchanged unless explicitly updated.
If Profile info is missing	Prompt user gently: "Complete your profile to unlock better resume building and coaching."
âœ… Profile = master data.
âœ… Resume = snapshot copies when needed.

ðŸ“‚ Technical Notes:
Store Profile data in structured tables in Supabase (WorkHistory, Education, Skills, Certifications, SummaryText linked to UserID).

Ensure Profile schema is stable and version-controlled (to avoid future migrations).

Resume Builder pulls from Profile but allows local editing without changing the Profile unless the user chooses "Update Profile" explicitly.

AI modules (coach, interview, career explorer) query live Profile data at the time of session generation.

ðŸ›  Deliverables:
âœ… Expanded editable sections in Account Settings.
âœ… Resume Builder, AI Coach, Interview Practice, and Career Explorer all pull from live Profile data.
âœ… Seamless sync with user updates.
âœ… Clear fallback UX if Profile info is incomplete.

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters:
ðŸŽ¯ Creates a true "Career OS" â€” user saves data once, benefits everywhere inside Ascentul.

âš¡ Speeds up resume building, coaching personalization, and interview preparation.

ðŸ”’ Reduces user frustration (no need to retype same info multiple times).

ðŸš€ Sets up future paid personalization features (AI-powered career plans, resume auto-optimization, interview feedback, etc.).
