Goal:
Build a Skill Stacker tool that connects to existing Career Goals and generates weekly AI-powered learning plans. Each goal gets its own learning stack with tasks that users can complete, track, and reflect on over time.

🔨 Feature Requirements
🔁 Career Goal Integration
Pull active goals from the existing Career Goal Tracker

Display each as a collapsible goal card

Only show active goals (status = active)

For each goal, show:

Goal title

Skill level or priority (if available)

🧠 Weekly Plan Generator (AI)
For each goal, generate a new plan every Monday

Each weekly plan includes:

3–5 tasks

Task type: Article, Video, Practice, Reflection

Title, estimated time, and resource link

Use OpenAI API to generate plans (fallback to static JSON during development)
