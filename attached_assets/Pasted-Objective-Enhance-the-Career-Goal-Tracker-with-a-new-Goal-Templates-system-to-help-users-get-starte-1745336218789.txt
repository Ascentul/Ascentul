Objective:
Enhance the Career Goal Tracker with a new Goal Templates system to help users get started faster with structured, pre-filled goal options like Job Change and Promotion Path. These template-based goals should function identically to manually created goals in every way.

🔨 1. Add "Popular Templates" Section to UI
Add a horizontal scrollable section labeled:
🔥 Popular Templates
Place it above the Active Goals block.

Each template card should include:

Emoji/icon (e.g. 🧭, 📣)

Template title

One-line description

CTA button: "Start with this Template"

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "icon": "🧭",
  "title": "Job Change",
  "summary": "Plan your next role with clarity.",
  "button": "Start with this Template"
}
🧩 2. Template Selection Behavior
When a user clicks "Start with this Template":

Open the existing New Goal modal or page

Pre-fill the form with:

Goal Title

Milestones (checkbox list)

Optional description

Users can fully edit the pre-filled content before saving.

🧱 3. Data Structure & Reusability
Create a reusable array of templates like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const goalTemplates = [
  {
    id: "job-change",
    icon: "🧭",
    title: "Job Change",
    summary: "Plan your next role with clarity.",
    prefill: {
      title: "Plan My Job Change",
      milestones: [
        "Complete self-assessment",
        "Update resume and portfolio",
        "Identify 5 target roles",
        "Submit 10 applications",
        "Prep for interviews"
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    id: "promotion-path",
    icon: "📣",
    title: "Promotion Path",
    summary: "Showcase your growth and move up.",
    prefill: {
      title: "Prepare for Promotion",
      milestones: [
        "Track 3 major achievements",
        "Request peer feedback",
        "Review skill gaps",
        "Meet with manager",
        "Present promotion case"
      ]
    }
  }
];
🧠 4. Make Template-Based Goals Function Like Normal Goals
Template-based goals should use the same schema and logic as all other goals:

Appear in Active/Completed Goals

Editable

Milestone tracking

Mark complete

Persistent across sessions

Store a flag in each goal:

js
Copy
Edit
createdFromTemplate: true
templateId: "job-change"
(optional for analytics or future filtering)

🎨 5. Optional Visual Enhancements
Display a small badge or icon next to goals created from templates:

text
Copy
Edit
📂 From Template
Allow users to filter or sort by "Template Goals" in the UI.

📱 6. Responsiveness & Mobile UX
Template bar should be horizontally scrollable on mobile.

Maintain clean, swipe-friendly experience across viewports.
