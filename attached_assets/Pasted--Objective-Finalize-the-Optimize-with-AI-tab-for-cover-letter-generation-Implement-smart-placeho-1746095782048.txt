 Objective: Finalize the "Optimize with AI" tab for cover letter generation. Implement smart placeholder handling, remove meta commentary, polish UX, relocate the copy button, and add copy confirmation feedback. This update brings the feature to production-grade quality.

✅ Part 1: Fix AI Placeholder Handling
If the user’s name (or other fields like email, phone, etc.) is fewer than 2 characters, fallback to default placeholders like [Your Name].

js
Copy
Edit
const nameToDisplay = userName && userName.length >= 2 ? userName : "[Your Name]";
Apply similar fallback logic for:

Email → [Email Address]

Phone → [Phone Number]

Address → [Your Address]

✅ Part 2: Strip AI Meta Commentary from Output
Sometimes the AI adds a closing paragraph like:

“This cover letter effectively aligns your experience…”
or “Overall, this demonstrates…”

These must be stripped from the final output.

🔧 Post-Processing Function:
js
Copy
Edit
function cleanAIOutput(text) {
  const cutoff = text.indexOf('---');
  if (cutoff !== -1) return text.slice(0, cutoff).trim();

  const lines = text.split('\n');
  const filteredLines = lines.filter(line => {
    return !line.toLowerCase().startsWith('this cover letter') &&
           !line.toLowerCase().startsWith('overall') &&
           !line.toLowerCase().startsWith('the above text');
  });
  return filteredLines.join('\n').trim();
}
Run this on the output before rendering.

Also update the OpenAI prompt to include:

“Only return the professional cover letter text. Do not include commentary or summaries.”

✅ Part 3: Copy Button Relocation + Toast Feedback
🔧 Move Copy Button:
Remove the current floating copy icon from the scrollable content box.

Add a new 📋 Copy button in the bottom action row, between Reset and Save as Cover Letter.

🔧 Button Row Layout:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
← Reset         📋 Copy         💾 Save as Cover Letter
🔧 On Click Behavior:
Copy the full AI-generated content to clipboard

Show a small toast message at bottom of screen or below the button:

Text: ✅ Copied to clipboard

Duration: 2–3 seconds

Use Tailwind transitions for fade-in/fade-out (optional)

✅ Part 4: UX Feedback Polish
After generating content, scroll or focus the user view to the AI-generated content panel.

Optional: Add a slight fade-in effect so the result feels fresh and responsive.

✅ Design Guidelines
Use consistent Tailwind styling from other sections

Maintain mobile responsiveness (flex-col md:flex-row)

Ensure touch targets are accessible on all screen sizes
