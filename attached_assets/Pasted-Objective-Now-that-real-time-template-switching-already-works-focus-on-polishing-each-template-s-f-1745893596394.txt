Objective:
Now that real-time template switching already works, focus on polishing each templateâ€™s formatting and layout for a clean, professional, launch-ready experience.

ðŸ“„ Core Tasks:
1. Polish Template Styling (Classic, Minimal, Professional, Modern)
For each template:


Element	Style Rules
Name Header	Large, bold. Each template should have slightly different font sizes and spacing.
Contact Info	Smaller font size. Use clean separators like dots (â€¢) or pipes (
Section Titles (Skills, Summary, Experience, Education)	Capitalized and bold for most templates. (Minimal = lowercase and lighter weight.)
Section Spacing	Tighten vertical spacing â€” slightly closer sections to feel like a professional resume, not a marketing page.
Skill Pills	Tighter spacing between pills. In Minimal template, use slightly lighter pill borders.
Date Formatting	Change date format to Month Year:
Example: "Dec 2023 â€“ Present" instead of "12/05/23 - Present".	
Borders/Dividers	- Light thin dividers between major sections in Classic and Professional.
- Minimal = no dividers.
- Modern = optional divider below name only.
Bullet Styling	Keep bullets simple and clean (â€¢). If bullets are used, ensure even alignment.
2. Improve Print and Download Matching
When the user downloads the resume:

The PDF file must exactly match what they see in the live preview.

Fonts, spacing, margins, and colors should not shift between preview and download.

3. Responsiveness
Preview should still look polished when resizing the browser window.

Resume content should not break into strange lines or cause layout glitches.

ðŸ›  Deliverable:
âœ… All four templates (Classic, Minimal, Professional, Modern) are polished and professional.
âœ… Consistent WYSIWYG experience (preview = download).
âœ… Final formatting matches resume industry standards (spacing, hierarchy, readability).
âœ… Launch-ready visual quality.

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Update Matters:
Professional polish instantly builds user trust.

Templates feel "finished," ready for user download and real-world use.

You eliminate churn from users feeling resumes "look weird" or "download broken."
