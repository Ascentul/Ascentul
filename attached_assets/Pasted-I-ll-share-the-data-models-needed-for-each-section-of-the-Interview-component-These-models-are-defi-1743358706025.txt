I'll share the data models needed for each section of the Interview component. These models are defined in the shared/schema.ts file and implemented in the server/storage.ts file.

1. Question Library
Data Model: InterviewQuestion

export type InterviewQuestion = {
  id: number;
  category: string;         // "behavioral", "technical", "situational"
  question: string;         // The actual interview question text
  suggestedAnswer: string | null; // Suggested approach/answer
  difficultyLevel: number;  // 1=Easy, 2=Medium, 3=Hard
}
 
// For inserting new questions
export type InsertInterviewQuestion = {
  category: string;
  question: string;
  suggestedAnswer?: string | null;
  difficultyLevel?: number;
}

2. Practice History
Data Model: InterviewPractice

export type InterviewPractice = {
  id: number;
  userId: number;           // User who practiced
  questionId: number;       // Reference to the question that was practiced
  userAnswer: string | null; // User's answer to the question
  confidence: number | null; // User confidence (1-5 scale)
  practiceDate: Date;       // When the practice occurred
}
 
// For inserting new practice entries
export type InsertInterviewPractice = {
  userId: number;
  questionId: number;
  userAnswer?: string | null;
  confidence?: number | null;
  practiceDate?: Date;
}

3. AI Question Generator
This feature doesn't have a specific data model as it dynamically generates questions. However, it interfaces with the OpenAI API and returns an array of generated questions:

// Sample generated question structure (not stored in database)
type GeneratedQuestion = {
  question: string;
  explanation?: string;
}

The generated questions can optionally be saved to the InterviewQuestion model if needed.

4. Interview Process
This section uses multiple related models to track the full interview journey:

Data Model: InterviewProcess

export type InterviewProcess = {
  id: number;
  userId: number;            // User who owns this process
  companyName: string;       // Company being interviewed with
  position: string;          // Job position
  status: string;            // "In Progress", "Completed", "Rejected", "Pending"
  jobDescription: string | null; // Job description
  contactName: string | null; // Primary contact at company
  contactEmail: string | null; // Contact email
  contactPhone: string | null; // Contact phone
  notes: string | null;      // General notes about the process
  createdAt: Date;           // When the process was created
  updatedAt: Date;           // When the process was last updated
}
 
// For inserting new interview processes
export type InsertInterviewProcess = {
  userId: number;
  companyName: string;
  position: string;
  status: string;
  jobDescription?: string | null;
  contactName?: string | null;
  contactEmail?: string | null;
  contactPhone?: string | null;
  notes?: string | null;
}

Data Model: InterviewStage

export type InterviewStage = {
  id: number;
  processId: number;         // Reference to the interview process
  type: string;              // "Phone Screening", "Technical Interview", etc.
  scheduledDate: Date | null; // When the interview is scheduled
  completedDate: Date | null; // When the interview was completed
  location: string | null;    // Interview location
  interviewers: string[] | null; // Names of interviewers
  feedback: string | null;    // Feedback received
  outcome: string | null;     // Result of this stage
  nextSteps: string | null;   // Next steps after this stage
  notes: string | null;       // General notes
  createdAt: Date;            // When this stage was created
  updatedAt: Date;            // When this stage was last updated
}
 
// For inserting new interview stages
export type InsertInterviewStage = {
  processId: number;
  type: string;
  scheduledDate?: Date | null;
  location?: string | null;
  interviewers?: string[] | null;
  notes?: string | null;
}

Data Model: FollowupAction

export type FollowupAction = {
  id: number;
  processId: number;         // Reference to the interview process
  stageId: number | null;    // Optional reference to a specific stage
  type: string;              // "Thank You Email", "Prepare Questions", etc.
  description: string;       // Description of the action
  dueDate: Date | null;      // When the action is due
  completed: boolean;        // Whether the action has been completed
  completedDate: Date | null; // When the action was completed
  notes: string | null;      // Additional notes
  createdAt: Date;           // When this action was created
  updatedAt: Date;           // When this action was last updated
}
 
// For inserting new followup actions
export type InsertFollowupAction = {
  processId: number;
  stageId?: number | null;
  type: string;
  description: string;
  dueDate?: Date | null;
  notes?: string | null;
}

These data models allow for a comprehensive tracking of the interview journey:

The InterviewProcess tracks the overall interview process with a company
InterviewStage tracks each individual stage of the process (phone screen, technical interview, etc.)
FollowupAction tracks specific tasks related to the interview (sending thank you emails, preparing questions, etc.)
The combination of these models creates a full picture of a user's job application and interview journey, making it easy to track status, next steps, and important dates.
