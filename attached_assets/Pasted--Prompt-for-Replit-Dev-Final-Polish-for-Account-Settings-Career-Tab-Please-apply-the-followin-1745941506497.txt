üß† Prompt for Replit Dev ‚Äî Final Polish for Account Settings > Career Tab

Please apply the following improvements to the AccountSettings.tsx component and associated styles to finalize the Career tab UI:

‚úÖ 1. Remove Duplicate Career Summary Section
Issue: There are currently two "Career Summary" sections displayed.

Fix:

Remove the bottom duplicate (the second Career Summary block at the end of the page).

Keep only the top Career Summary section, which includes the + Add Summary button in the top right.

üíÖ 2. Add Consistent Section Spacing & Borders
Apply consistent top and bottom margin between each major section (Career Summary, Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications).

Suggested utility: className="my-6" or mb-6 mt-6

Optional: Add a light border or shadow to visually separate sections

Example: className="border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-4 shadow-sm"

üìä 3. Improve Profile Completion Feedback
Enhance the progress bar to show visual progression:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="w-full h-2 rounded-full bg-gray-200 mt-2">
  <div
    className="h-2 bg-indigo-600 rounded-full transition-all duration-300"
    style={{ width: `${completionPercentage}%` }}
  />
</div>
<p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">
  Complete your profile to unlock better AI recommendations
</p>
Replace the current static 20% label with this component using the actual completion percentage.

üî† 4. Standardize Typography Across Sections
Ensure each section title uses:

tsx
Copy
Edit
className="text-lg font-semibold mb-1"
Ensure section subtitles/descriptions use:

tsx
Copy
Edit
className="text-sm text-gray-500"
üßº 5. Remove Redundant Inner CTA Buttons
For all sections (Career Summary, Certifications, Skills, etc.):

Remove the large blue CTA buttons inside the empty-state boxes, such as:

"Add Career Summary"

"Add Certification"

"Add Skill"

The top-right ‚Äú+ Add‚Äù buttons are sufficient and cleaner UX.

‚úÖ Completion Checklist
 Only one Career Summary section remains

 Section spacing is consistent

 Profile completion bar is dynamic and styled

 Headers and descriptions are aligned in font size & weight

 No inner blue buttons inside empty-state cards
