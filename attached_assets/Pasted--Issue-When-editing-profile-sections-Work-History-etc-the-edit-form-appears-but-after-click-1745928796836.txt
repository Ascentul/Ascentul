ðŸ“‹ Issue:
When editing profile sections (Work History, etc.), the edit form appears, but after clicking Save, the new information does not persist in the database and does not update the UI.

âœ… Required Fixes:
1. Ensure Save Button Triggers Correct Database Call

Expected Behavior	Technical Requirements
After user fills out the form and clicks Save, a Supabase insert() or update() API call is triggered.	Must save the new or edited record associated with the current user's ID.
Catch success and failure cases	If save succeeds: show success toast. If save fails: show error toast.
âœ… Example (pseudo-code):

tsx
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('WorkHistory')
  .insert([{ user_id: user.id, job_title, company, start_date, end_date, description }]);

if (error) {
  showToast('Error saving work history');
} else {
  showToast('Work history saved successfully');
}
2. Refresh Profile Data After Save

Expected Behavior	Technical Requirements
After successful save, refetch the updated data.	Use invalidateQueries or refetch manually (depending on how your queryClient is set up).
âœ… Example:

tsx
Copy
Edit
queryClient.invalidateQueries('careerData');
or

tsx
Copy
Edit
refetchCareerData();
âœ… This forces the frontend to pull the new updated list from Supabase and re-render the UI without a page reload.

3. Error Handling and User Feedback
If the Supabase insert/update fails (e.g., network issue, bad payload), show a clear error toast.

If the save succeeds, show a success toast and automatically close the modal.

âœ… This way users know immediately what happened.

ðŸ›  Deliverables:
âœ… "Save" button correctly writes new data to Supabase.
âœ… New/updated data appears immediately in the UI without manual reload.
âœ… Toast feedback on success/failure.
âœ… Clean handling of multiple fields (Work History, Education, Skills, Certifications).

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Fix Matters:
Users can now properly update their career profile.

Resume Studio, AI Coach, Interview Practice, Career Explorer will work correctly because the data will exist.

Smooth user experience = higher profile completion = better product stickiness.
