Objective:
Replace the current basic modal ("Resume Preview: Title + Download") with a real, live-rendered resume preview formatted using the selected resume template, with AI-assisted formatting adjustments for clean output.

ðŸ“„ Changes to Implement:
1. Replace the Current Preview Modal
When a user clicks "Preview":

Open a new modal or full-screen modal (depending on UX flow).

Render the full formatted resume directly inside the modal.

Apply the selected templateâ€™s styles (fonts, layout, colors, margins).

2. Auto-Format Resume Content Using AI Rules
Before rendering, clean and format the userâ€™s resume data dynamically:

Ensure proper line breaks between sections.

Auto-fit resume to 1â€“2 pages if possible (adjust font size/margins slightly if needed).

Ensure no broken layouts (like dangling bullet points, cutoff headers, or giant gaps).

Handle long or short sections gracefully (dynamic spacing).

3. Include "Download PDF" Inside the Preview
Keep the "Download PDF" button inside the new preview modal.

Placement:

Top right corner, secondary button style (smaller than primary preview content).

4. Add Loading State (If Needed)
If rendering takes longer than 500ms:

Show a simple loading spinner or animation.

Example text:

"Preparing your preview..."

5. Frontend Requirements:
Responsive preview (looks good on desktop and tablet).

Allow scrolling inside the modal if the resume is longer than 1 page.

Close button ("X") in top right to return to Resume Studio.

ðŸ“‚ Additional Notes:
If possible, generate the preview using HTML/CSS templates â€” avoid relying solely on PDFs for previewing.

Optional: Lazy-load large sections (work history, skills, etc.) if resume is huge.

ðŸ›  Deliverable:
A fully functional live preview of the resume.

Resume is properly formatted inside the selected template.

User can visually confirm resume looks correct before downloading.

"Download PDF" button remains available after preview.

ðŸŽ¯ After This Update:
âœ… Resume Studio will feel trustworthy, modern, and professional.
âœ… UX will match user expectations from tools like Notion, Canva, and Google Docs.
âœ… No surprises or friction when users are creating or downloading resumes.
