Build a "Universities" page inside an Admin Dashboard using React and TailwindCSS. This page will allow the admin to manage university clients that have purchased licenses and enable those universities to onboard their students.

The page should include the following features:

---

🔹 1. Page Header
- Title: “Universities”
- Button: “Add New University” (opens modal)

---

🔹 2. Universities Table (Main Section)
A responsive, scrollable table with these columns:
- University Name
- Admin Email
- License Plan (Starter / Pro / Enterprise)
- Seats Used / Total (e.g. 87 / 100)
- License Expiry Date
- Status (Active / Expired / Suspended)
- Actions dropdown:
  - View Dashboard
  - Edit
  - Suspend
  - Add Seats
  - Reset Admin

Include search by name/email, and filters:
- Status: All / Active / Expired / Suspended
- Expiring Soon (next 30 days)

---

🔹 3. Add New University Modal
Fields:
- University Name
- Admin Name
- Admin Email
- License Plan (dropdown)
- Number of Seats
- Start & Expiry Date

On submit:
- Automatically generate a universityId
- Send email invite to admin with temporary login/setup link
- Create a linked admin account

---

🔹 4. University Detail Drawer or Page
Clicking a university row opens a side panel or separate page with:
- Name, Admin contact info
- License stats (total seats, used, remaining)
- License expiration
- Engagement chart: # logins, feature usage, student completion rate
- Admin controls: Suspend, Extend license, Reset admin login

---

🔹 5. Styling
- Use Tailwind dark mode and modern card styling
- Clean, modern sans-serif font (Inter or Poppins)
- Use icons (Lucide or Phosphor Icons)
- Add hover states and transition animations
- Color-coded badges for license status and plan type

---

💾 Data Structure (mock JSON or useEffect)
Each university should include:
- id, name, adminName, adminEmail
- licensePlan, licenseSeats, licenseUsed, licenseStart, licenseEnd
- status (active, expired, suspended)
- universityId (used to generate invite links)

---

Modularize components:
- UniversitiesTable
- UniversityRow
- AddUniversityModal
- UniversityDetailDrawer
- LicenseBadge
- StatusTag
