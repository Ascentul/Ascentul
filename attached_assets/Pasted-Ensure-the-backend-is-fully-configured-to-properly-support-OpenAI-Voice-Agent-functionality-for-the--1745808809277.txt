Ensure the backend is fully configured to properly support OpenAI Voice Agent functionality for the Voice Interview Practice feature:

Required Backend Configuration:
Speech-to-Text API (Whisper-1):

Accept incoming audio from the frontend (user recordings).

Forward the audio via POST request to OpenAI’s Speech-to-Text endpoint:

Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Model: "whisper-1"

Language: "en"

Response format: "text"

Receive the transcription text and return it cleanly to the frontend.

Chat Completion API (gpt-4o):

After transcription, send the conversation context (system prompt, conversation history, and new user input) to the Chat Completions API:

Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Model: "gpt-4o"

Temperature: 0.7

Stream: true

Return the AI-generated text response to the backend.

Text-to-Speech API (TTS-1-HD):

After receiving the text response from Chat Completions:

Forward the AI response text via POST request to OpenAI’s Text-to-Speech API:

Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech

Model: "tts-1-hd"

Voice: "nova" (or another selected natural-sounding voice)

Stream or receive the audio output file.

Send the audio back to the frontend for playback.

Session Management:

Maintain session memory:

Store recent conversation history (questions and user answers) during active practice.

Optionally use short-term storage (e.g., server session or temporary in-memory object) to maintain context between each microphone interaction.

Ensure conversation resets cleanly when a new session starts or when the user ends the current session.

Security and API Keys:

Securely store OpenAI API keys (do not expose keys to the frontend).

Use server-side calls to OpenAI APIs for all Whisper, Chat, and TTS endpoints.

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., transcription failures, API timeouts, streaming issues).

Latency and Streaming Optimization (Optional Advanced Step):

If possible, stream partial transcriptions or AI responses to minimize wait time for users.

Allow real-time playback without requiring full audio file download if supported.

✅ Goal: Ensure seamless recording → transcription → AI reply → text-to-speech playback cycle, fully server-secured and optimized for user experience.
